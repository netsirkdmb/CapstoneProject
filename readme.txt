#Note: I'm not sure how long these links will remain active.

Using the Website:
Initially, you can log in using the backdoor login. This will log you in as Kristen for both admin and award page.
Backdoor:
Username: test
Password: test


The landing page is:
https://www.employeerecognitionangama.co.uk/login


You should login as an admin first, which will take you to the create user page (first link). Here, you can create a new user account with your own email. Then, head to the administrator page (second link) and create your own admin account. They can use the same email and password since separate user types exist as separate records in separate tables in the database. You will need your own accounts to test the email features.
